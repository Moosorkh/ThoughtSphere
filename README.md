# ThoughtSphere

## Description

ThoughtSphere is a backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It is designed to manage user thoughts, reactions, and relationships. The project demonstrates CRUD API functionality, allowing seamless integration into larger applications or as a standalone backend solution.

- **Motivation:** To showcase how to create a robust RESTful API using Node.js and MongoDB.
- **Purpose:** Built to solve the challenge of efficiently managing data interactions in a social network context.
- **Problem Solved:** Facilitates handling user-generated content and interactions in a scalable and structured way.
- **What I Learned:** Improved my understanding of MongoDB schemas, subdocuments, virtuals, and RESTful API principles.

### **DELETE** `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId`

## Features
- Users: Create, read, update, and delete users.
- Thoughts: Manage user-generated thoughts.
- Reactions: Add or remove reactions to thoughts.
- MongoDB Integration: All data is stored and retrieved using MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Virtuals: Thought schema uses virtuals for dynamic fields (e.g., reaction count).

## Code Examples
### Thought Model with Reactions
```javascript
const reactionSchema = new Schema({
    reactionId: {
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        default: () => new Types.ObjectId(),
    },
    reactionBody: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        maxlength: 280,
    },
    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    createdAt: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now,
        get: (timestamp) => new Date(timestamp).toLocaleString(),
    },
});

const thoughtSchema = new Schema({
    thoughtText: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 1,
        maxlength: 280,
    },
    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    },
    reactions: [reactionSchema],
});
```
### User model
```Javascript
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const userSchema = new Schema({
    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
        trim: true,
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
        match: [/.+@.+\..+/, 'Must match a valid email address'],
    },
    thoughts: [
        {
            type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: 'Thought',
        },
    ],
    friends: [
        {
            type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: 'User',
        },
    ],
},
    {
        toJSON: {
            virtuals: true,
        },
        id: false,
    });

// Create a virtual for friend count
userSchema.virtual('friendCount').get(function () {
    return this.friends.length;
});

const User = model('User', userSchema);

export default User;
```
